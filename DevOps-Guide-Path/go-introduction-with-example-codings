## Download and install Go in linux 
* Go to this link (https://go.dev/dl/) and Donwload this package for linux
- go1.22.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
* Remove any previous Go installation
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
* Change the file permission to root
$ sudo chown -R root:root ./go
* Move the file to user
$ sudo mv -v go /usr/local
* Setting up go lang PATH environment on linux
$ vi ~/.bash_profile
* Append the following 2 lines to set up GOPATH and $PATH (see how to set path variables on Linux):
# set up Go lang path #
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin
---
Example guidelines regarding PATH in linux
https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-adding-path/
https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/$PATH
* to update the bash/sheel environment
$ source ~/.bash_profile
* Verify that you've installed Go 
$ go version
Output:
go version go1.22.2 linux/amd64

# Go Modules
* Modules help with managing dependencies, choosing which versions to use, and making sure that builds can be repeated exactly. They also allow people to run Go code from anywhere, not just in the GOPATH.
* Using Modules is pretty straightforward. Select any directory outside GOPATH as the root of your project, and create a new module with the go mod init command.
* A go.mod file will be generated, containing the module path, a Go version, and its dependency requirements, which are the other modules needed for a successful build.
* If no <modulepath> is specified, go mod init will try to guess the module path from the directory structure. It can also be overridden by supplying an argument.
* Creating a directory go into that directory
$ mkdir go-project
$ cd go-project
$ go mod init <modulepath>
* A go.mod file could look like this:
$ cat go.mod
module example.com/m

go 1.22.2
* The built-in documentation provides an overview of all available 
$ go help mod
$ go hep mod init

# Refactoring and your tooling
* We should be familiar enough with your editor to perform the following with a simple key combination:
- 'Extract/Inline variable' Being able to take magic values and give them a name lets you simplify your code quickly.
- 'Extract method/function' It is vital to be able to take a section of code and extract functions/methods.
- 'Rename' You should be able to confidently rename symbols across files.
- 'go fmt' Go has an opinioned formatter called go fmt. Your editor should be running this on every file save.
- 'Run tests' You should be able to do any of the above and then quickly re-run your tests to ensure your refactoring hasn't broken anything.
In addition, to help you work with your code you should be able to:
- 'View function signature' You should never be unsure how to call a function in Go. Your IDE should describe a function in terms of its documentation, its parameters and what it returns.
- 'View function definition' If it's still not clear what a function does, you should be able to jump to the source code and try and figure it out yourself.
- 'Find usages of a symbol' Being able to see the context of a function being called can help your decision process when refactoring.

# Hello, world codes
* Create a folder
$ vi hello.go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world")
}

* Run go file
$ go run hello.go

# How it works
* When you write a program in Go, you will have a main package defined with a main func inside it. Packages are ways of grouping up related Go code together.
* The func keyword is how you define a function with a name and a body.
* With import "fmt" we are importing a package which contains the Println function that we use to print.

* Now create a new file called 'hello_test.go' where we are going to write a test for our 'Hello' function
$ vi hello_test.go
package main

import "testing"

func TestHello(t *testing.T) {
	got := Hello()
	want := "Hello, world"

	if got != want {
		t.Errorf("got %q want %q", got, want)
	}
}

* The next step is to run the tests. Enter go test in your terminal. If the tests pass, then you are probably using an earlier version of Go. However, if you are using Go 1.16 or later, then the tests will likely not run at all. Instead, you will see an error message like this in the terminal:
$ go test
Output:
PASS
ok  	example.com/m	0.001s
* If you encounter any problem just run 'go mod init hello' in your terminal

* Rewrite the 'hello_test.go' file
$ vi hello_test.go
package main

import "testing"

func TestHello(t *testing.T) {
	got := Hello("Chris")
	want := "Hello, Chris"

	if got != want {
		t.Errorf("got %q want %q", got, want)
	}
}
Output:
# example.com/m [example.com/m.test]
./hello_test.go:6:15: too many arguments in call to Hello
	have (string)
	want ()
FAIL	example.com/m [build failed]

* Rewrite the 'hello.go' file
$ vi hello.go
package main

import "fmt"

func Hello(name string) string {
	return "Hello, world"
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Hello("world"))
}
Output:
--- FAIL: TestHello (0.00s)
    hello_test.go:10: got "Hello, world" want "Hello, Chris"
FAIL
exit status 1
FAIL	example.com/m	0.001s

* Rewrite the 'hello.go' file again
$ vi hello.go
package main

import "fmt"

func Hello(name string) string {
	return "Hello, " + name
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Hello("world"))
}
Output:
PASS
ok  	example.com/m	0.001s
* When you run the tests they should now pass.

* const - used to store a value/data.
* Rewrite the 'hello.go' file again.
$ vi hello.go
package main

import "fmt"

const englishHelloPrefix = "Hello, "

func Hello(name string) string {
	return englishHelloPrefix + name
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Hello("world"))
}

*The next requirement is when our function is called with an empty string it defaults to printing "Hello, World", rather than "Hello, "
* Rewrite the 'hello_test.go' and 'hello.go' file
$ vi hello_test.go
package main

import "testing"

func TestHello(t *testing.T) {
	t.Run("saying hello to people", func(t *testing.T) {
		got := Hello("Chris")
		want := "Hello, Chris"

		if got != want {
			t.Errorf("got %q want %q", got, want)
		}
	})
	t.Run("say 'Hello, World' when an empty string is supplied", func(t *testing.T) {
		got := Hello("")
		want := "Hello, World"

		if got != want {
			t.Errorf("got %q want %q", got, want)
		}
	})
}
$ vi hello.go
package main

import "fmt"

const englishHelloPrefix = "Hello, "

func Hello(name string) string {
	if name == "" {
		name = "World"
	}
	return englishHelloPrefix + name
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Hello("world"))
}

* Rewrite the 'hello_test.go' file
$ vi hello_test.go
package main

import "testing"

func TestHello(t *testing.T) {
        t.Run("saying hello to people", func(t *testing.T) {
                got := Hello("Chris")
                want := "Hello, Chris"
                assertCorrectMessage(t, got, want)
        })

        t.Run("empty string defaults to 'world'", func(t *testing.T) {
                got := Hello("")
                want := "Hello, World"
                assertCorrectMessage(t, got, want)
        })

}

func assertCorrectMessage(t testing.TB, got, want string) {
        t.Helper()
        if got != want {
                t.Errorf("got %q want %q", got, want)
        }
}
* We've made our test code cleaner by creating a new function for checking conditions. This makes our tests easier to understand and reduces repetition. When using this function, we pass in 't *testing.T' so that if something goes wrong, the test fails properly. To help with testing, it's best to accept 'testing.TB', which can work with both tests and benchmarks. Using 't.Helper()' in our function tells the testing system that it's a helper function. This helps to pinpoint errors better when tests fail. If this seems confusing, you can ignore 't.Helper()' for now and see how test output changes when you comment it out. Comments in Go are great for adding extra info or temporarily disabling code. You can comment out 't.Helper()' by adding '//' at the beginning of the line.
* Rewrite the 'hello_test.go' file and add new requirements
$ vi hello_test.go
#add this to the file.
        t. Run("in Spanish", func(t *testing.T) {
                got := Hello("Elodie", "Spanish")
                want := "Hola, Elodie"
                assertCorrectMessage(t, got, want)
        })
* Dont forget to test it first.
$ go test
Output:
# example.com/m [example.com/m.test]
./hello_test.go:12:26: too many arguments in call to Hello
	have (string, string)
	want (string)
FAIL	example.com/m [build failed]
* Fix the compilation problems by adding another string argument to Hello
$ go hello.go
#edit and add this new func.
func Hello(name string, language string) string {
	if name == "" {
		name = "World"
	}
	return englishHelloPrefix + name
}
Output:
# example.com/m [example.com/m.test]
./hello.go:15:20: not enough arguments in call to Hello
	have (string)
	want (string, string)
./hello_test.go:7:16: not enough arguments in call to Hello
	have (string)
	want (string, string)
./hello_test.go:17:16: not enough arguments in call to Hello
	have (string)
	want (string, string)
FAIL	example.com/m [build failed]

* Rewrite the 'hello_test.go' file
$ vi hello_test.go
#edit and add this new func..
	if language == "Spanish" {
		return "Hola, " + name
	}
* Rewrite and refactor the 'hello.go' and 'hello_test.go' file
$ vi hello.go
package main

import "fmt"

const spanish = "Spanish"
const englishHelloPrefix = "Hello, "
const spanishHelloPrefix = "Hola, "

func Hello(name string, language string) string {
	if name == "" {
		name = "World"
	}

	if language == spanish {
		return spanishHelloPrefix + name
	}

	return englishHelloPrefix + name
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Hello("world", "English"))
}
$ vi hello_test.go
package main

import "testing"

func TestHello(t *testing.T) {
	t.Run("saying hello to people", func(t *testing.T) {
		got := Hello("Chris", "")
		want := "Hello, Chris"
		assertCorrectMessage(t, got, want)
	})
	t.Run("in Spanish", func(t *testing.T) {
		got := Hello("Elodie", "Spanish")
		want := "Hola, Elodie"
		assertCorrectMessage(t, got, want)
	})
	t.Run("empty string defaults to 'world'", func(t *testing.T) {
		got := Hello("", "")
		want := "Hello, World"
		assertCorrectMessage(t, got, want)
	})

}

func assertCorrectMessage(t testing.TB, got, want string) {
	t.Helper()
	if got != want {
		t.Errorf("got %q want %q", got, want)
	}
}

* you can also refactor the const and func value like this.
$ vi hello.go
package main

import "fmt"

const (
	spanish = "Spanish"
	englishHelloPrefix = "Hello, "
	spanishHelloPrefix = "Hola, "
)

func Hello(name string, language string) string {
	if name == "" {
		name = "World"
	}

	if language == spanish {
		return spanishHelloPrefix + name
	}

	return greetingPrefix(language) + name
}

func greetingPrefix(language string) (prefix string) {
	switch language {
	case spanish:
		prefix = spanishHelloPrefix
	default:
		prefix = englishHelloPrefix
	}
	return
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Hello("world", "English"))
}

# concepts:
* In our function signature we have made a named return value (prefix string).
* This will create a variable called prefix in your function.
* It will be assigned the "zero" value. This depends on the type, for example ints are 0 and for strings it is "".
* You can return whatever it's set to by just calling return rather than return prefix.
* This will display in the Go Doc for your function so it can make the intent of your code clearer.
* default in the switch case will be branched to if none of the other case statements match.
* The function name starts with a lowercase letter. In Go, public functions start with a capital letter and private ones start with a lowercase. We don't want the internals of our algorithm to be exposed to the world, so we made this function private.
* Also, we can group constants in a block instead of declaring them each on their own line. It's a good idea to use a line between sets of related constants for readability.
