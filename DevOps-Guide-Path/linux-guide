systemctl disable <SERVICE_NAME> - don't start automatically when the system boots up.
/usr/lib/systemd/system/<SERVICE_NAME> - where the service stored.
systemctl cat <SERVICE_NAME> - to identify which script will run before the service starts. #Sample: systemctl cat <SERVICE_NAME>

## Switching and Routing ##
ip link - to list and modify interfaces on the host IP.
ip addr - to see the IP addresses assigned to those interfaces.
ip addr add <IP_Address/Sub_Network> dev eth0 - used to set IP addresses on the interfaces.
NOTE: changes made using these commands are only valid until a restart. if you want to persist these changes, you must set them in the /etc/* network interfaces file
ip route/route - used to view the routing table.
ip route add <IP_Address_Network/Sub_Network> via <IP_Address_Destination> - used to add entries into the routing table.
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward - to check if IP forwarding is enabled on a host. If you are working with a host configured as a router.

## DNS in linux system ##
cat /etc/hosts - file used in matching an FQDN with the server IP hosting a specific domain.
cat /etc/resolv.conf - it is commonly used to manage DNS requests on Linux systems.
different command in /etc/resolv.conf:
nameserver <DNS_SERVER>- configure nameserver that points to the DNS and then query.
search <departmentA.org> <departmentB.org> - when we query a domain name, the resolver will combine the domain name with the search domain to form a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for querying.
sortlist <34.101.0.0/255.255.0.0> - to specify a list of the IP addresses that we want to prioritize in the case where 1 domain name resolves to multiple IP addresses.
options <timeout:5> - is the duration the resolver will wait for the DNS to resolve before its timeout.
options <ndots:3> - configures the minimum number of dots a domain name can have, which makes the resolver query it is an absolute domain name.
options <attempts:5> - set the number of tries the resolver gets to resolve a domain name before it gives up.
options <rotate> - makes the resolver rotate the list of configured nameservers in a round-robin fashion.
cat /etc/nsswitch.conf - file specifies the methods to use and the order in which to use them when looking for a certain type of information.
RECORD TYPES stored in DNS Server:
A - it stores IP to hostnames that's known.
AAAA - storing IPV6 to hostnames.
CNAME - mapping to one name to another name.
nslookup <SERVER_NAME> - to query a hostname from a DNS server.
dig <SERVER_NAME> - is a useful tool to test DNS name resolution.
