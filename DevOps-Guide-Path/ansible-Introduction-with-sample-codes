## Ansible Introduction - Ansible is a powerful ID Automation tool that you can learn quickly.
Install VirtualBox on your local machine LINK: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

osboxes.org - Go to this site and select the VM images and then you'll find a list of various different OS.
NOTE: In your local machine for example windows OS by default Virtualization Technology is disabled go to google or restart your local machine and enable it.

In this demo we will deploying 3 servers 1 for ansible-controller and 2 for ansible-target server.
VirtualBox Installation Guide: Create Virtual New Machine > Version should be the VM Images you downloaded then next > Memory size should be 2Gb > Hard disk Locate 'Use an existing virtual hard disk file' and then find your downloaded images then click OK > Before powering on the template, Go to settings and go to System locate processor then increase the CPU from 1 to 2 > After that go to network section changed attached to 'Bridged Adpater' this way your VM gets an IP address as well as it can connect to the internet to download and install packages as required > to find the password of your download images/OS go the website osboxes.org/centos/ and go to the info section.

NOTE: The VM should be powered off or Shutdown
Cloning of created VirtualBox: Right click on centos-template and select clone > In the new machine name, name it ansible-controller make sure to check the box 'Reinitialize the MAC address of all network cards' > in the next page Clone type select 'Linked clone' a linked clone will basically is space saving > next is to clone another VirtualBox same process and name it ansible-target1 and so on.. Dont forget to start the servers.

Run terminal > type $ifconfig - this command tells the IP address currently assigned to the virtual machine.

Renaming the Host Server:
$sudo vi /etc/hostname - remove the data and replace to the correct one.
$sudo vi /etc/hosts - see below to change it or copy paste it to the file
127.0.0.1	localhost <HOST_NAME>
::1		localhost <HOST_NAME>
After the changes you must restart the system to applied the changes.
$ shutdown now -r - this command is to restart the server.
Repeat the process to ansible-target1 and ansible-target2

Below is the link how to install ansible packages.
Link: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/installation_distros.html#installing-ansible-from-epel

NOTE: Install only on your ansible-controller.
First is to try to ssh to the target server, this way the other server knows that the connection was secured.
$mkdir test-project
$cd test-project/
$cat > inventory.txt
target1 ansible_host=<HOST_IP_ADDRESS> ansible_ssh_pass=<HOST_PASSWD>
and then press CTRL-C to save it.
$ansible target1 -m ping -i inventory.txt - this command will perform a ping test through Ansible and make sure that it can establish a connection.
After successful pinging clone another VirtualBox and name it ansible-target2 then repeat the process.

## Ansible Concepts
#Invetory
* Ansible is agent less and it means that you don't need to install any additional software on the target machines to be able to work with Ansible.
* ansible_connection inventory parameter value to localhost to tell Ansible to make a local connection instead of ssh.
* winrm is the parameter we used if we want to connect to a windows OS.
* the default inventory file of Ansible is located at /etc/ansible/hosts.
Sample Inventory Parameters:
- ansible_connection - ssh/winrm/localhost
- ansible_port - 22/5986
- ansible_user - root/administrator
- ansible_ssh_pass - user/root password

#Ansible playbooks
* Ansible playbooks are Ansible, orchestration, language. It is in playbooks where we define what we want Ansible to do.
* To check the configure_database.yml playbook for syntax errors, you can use ansible-playbook --syntax-check configure_database.yml command.
* To run ansible-lint on the database_setup.yml playbook, use ansible-lint database_setup.yml command.
* To run update_service.yml playbook in check mode, use ansible-playbook update_service.yml --check command.
* To run the configure_database.yml playbook in both check mode and diff mode, use ansible-playbook configure_database.yml --check --diff command.
* If Ansible-lint provides no output after checking a playbook, it indicates that, the playbook adheres to best practices and has no style-related issues.

# Sample playbooks and inventory

# Ansible modules
* Ansible modules are categorized into various groups based on their functionality.
* Ansible_module_system, modifying IP tables, firewall configurations on the system, working with logical volume groups, mounting operations or working with services, for example starting, stopping, or restarting services in a system.
* Ansible_module_command are used to execute commands or scripts on a hosts. This could be simple commands using the command module or an interactive execution using the inspect module by responding to prompts.
* Ansible_module_file help work with files. For example, use the ACL module to set and retrieve ACL information on files, use the archive modules to compress and unpack files, use find lining file and replace modules to modify the contents of an existing file.
* Ansible_module_database help in working with databases such as MongoDB, MYSQL, or PostgreSQL to add or remove databases or modify database configurations.
* Ansible_module_cloud section has a vast collection of modules for various different cloud providers like Amazon, Azure, Docker, Google, Openstack and VMware being just a few of them.
* Ansible_module_windows are Windows modules that help you use Ansible in a Window environment. 
* command modules - executes a command on a remote node
* lineinfile - Search for a line in a file and replace it or add it if it doesn't exist.
* Ansible 'command' module support 'free_form' parameter. Ansible does support idempotancy.
* ansible-doc command to see the information about Ansible modules from command line.
# Sample custom module file
- name: Provision custom cloud resource
  custom_cloud:
    param1: value1
    param2: value
* Ansible plugin would you use to fetch real-time information about your AWS ec2 instances - Dynamic Inventory Plugin will be used to fetch real-time information about your AWS ec2 instances.
ansible-inventory --list -i aws_inventory.py - command to list all hosts in your AWS inventory.
* cisco.ios collection is specifically designed for managing Cisco IOS devices. 
* to deploy an application on AWS and need to set up ec2 instances using Ansible. ec2_instance module is primarily used for managing ec2 instances.

# Ansible variables
The secret of success is to do the common things uncommonly well.
* Ansible variables - stores information that varies with each host or different items.
# sample variable code within the playbooks
---
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    car_model: 'BMW M3'
    country_name: USA
    title: 'Systems Engineer'
  tasks:
    - command: 'echo "My car is {{ car_model }}"'
    - command: 'echo "I live in the {{ country_name }}"'

# Ansible conditionals
* sample codes using 'when' condition to run this task only on node02 host.
---
-  name: 'Execute a script on all web server nodes'
   hosts: all
   become: yes
   tasks:
     -  service: 'name=nginx state=started'
        when: 'ansible_host =="node02"'
* another sample of conditional that define vars age of localhost.
---
- name: 'Am I an Adult or a Child?'
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
    age: 25
  tasks:
    - name: I am a Child
      command: 'echo "I am a Child"'
      when: 'age < 18'
    - name: I am an Adult
      command: 'echo "I am an Adult"'
      when: 'age >= 18'
* other sample using conditional that uses register command
---
- name: 'Add name server entry if not already entered'
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - shell: 'cat /etc/resolv.conf'
      register: command_output

      when: 'command_output.stdout.find("10.0.250.10") == -1'

# Ansible loops
Loop is a looping directive that executes the same task multiple number of times. It stores the value of each item in the loop in a variable named item.
* with_* - everything you see after with_ string is a lookup plugin. This is a custom scripts that can do specific tasks like read files, connect to a URL or connect to a DB or connect to other systems like k8s or OpenShift.
* Example codes in Loop
---
-  name: 'Print list of fruits'
   hosts: localhost
   vars:
     fruits:
       - Apple
       - Banana
       - Grapes
       - Orange
   tasks:
     - command: 'echo "{{ item }}"'
       with_items: '{{ fruits }}'
* Another codes to update and to install all packages defined under packages variable.
---
- name: 'Install required packages'
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  vars:
    packages:
      - httpd
      - make
      - vim
  tasks:
    - yum:
        name: '{{ item }}'
        state: present
