# Step 1: Update the system repository
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install zsh -y

# Step 2: Check the installation
$ zsh --version

# Step 3: Set Zsh as Default Shell
* Check the shell first
$ echo $SHELL # The default output should be /usr/bash
$ chsh -s [path] [user]
[path] specifies the path to the shell you want to use.
[user] specifies the user for which you want to change the default shell. Not specifying the user changes the default shell for the current user.
- If you are unsure of the shell path, utilize the which command to specify the Zsh path automatically. For example:
$ chsh -s $(which zsh)
- The command changes the default shell to Zsh for the current user. To start using the Z Shell, log out of the terminal and log back in.

# Step 4: Install Oh My Zsh by running the following command:
$ sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"        

ADDITIONAL: make your terminal beautiful with zsh and PowerLevel10k
# clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k        

# Download Plugins for autosuggestion and syntax highlighting
$ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
$ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting        

# Edit your zshrc file
$ vi ~/.zshrc
* Find the ZSH_THME and replace it, see below for example
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"        
POWERLEVEL9K_MODE="nerdfont-complete"        
* Add the plugins which we downloaded
plugins=(
  git 
  zsh-autosuggestions 
  zsh-syntax-highlighting
)

# Now the last step, you will need to run '$ p10k configure' or use source to restart the configuration of zsh
$ source ~/.zshrc
